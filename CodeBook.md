Find in a brief the steps I follow to came up with a solution for the course project of Getting and Cleaning Data.

The TidyData.txt file contains was generated by the run_analysis.R script. It is the result of the following instructions:

1) Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
4) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5) From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.


### Steps that describe the script

1) Set the working directory correctly
2) Download and load file
3) Variable assignation
4) Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set
5) verification of the data (double check to see if data is correct)
6) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
7) verification of the data (double check to see if data is correct)
8) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
9) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names
10) Independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
11) apply the mean after we have groupped the data by subject and activity
12) Verification of the data (double check to see if data is correct)
13) Export the data to a text file
