# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data
Homeworks for week for of getting and cleaning data, Coursera

The data we used for this assignment relates to 30 people collecting data from their smartphones, which the UCI consolidated and published it on its own website as daily human activities.

Within this repo you'll find the following files:
  TidyData.txt --> It has the result of a set of instructions given by the course.
  CodeBook.md --> Contains the instructions and a summary of the logic used to get to the solution.
  run_analysis.R --> Code written by me to get to the solution described in the codebook.md
